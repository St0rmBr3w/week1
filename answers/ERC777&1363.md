Markdown file 1: Create a markdown file about what problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solves. Why was ERC1363 introduced, and what issues are there with ERC777?

ERC1363 was introduced to solve the problem that there were was no way to execute "Payable" business logic after ERC20 tokens were received. ERC20 tokens lack built-in transaction handling mechanisms, which these newer standards attempted to address.

The ability to trigger arbitrary execution of logic after tokens were received would have been incredibly useful, since this would simplify both the number of transactions users needed to invoke, as well as the gas cost associated and user experience when interacting with applications on the EVM.

ERC777 went a step further trying to be an "ERC 20 2.0" by enabling operators to send tokens on behalf of another contract or EOA, and offer "hooks" that a developer could use to trigger abritrary logic on send/receive.

However there were serious issues with the implementation and the assumptions that developers carried over.

Since ERC777 enabled the arbitrary execution of logic from an external contract during transfer, the ERC777 standard presented multiple opportunities for developers to miss re-entrancy issues because of the over-engineering of the contract.

For example, while a simple transfer might not inherently be re-entrant itself, if the atacker swaps ERC777 A for ERC777 B, they can potentially create a race condition where when `transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender)` is executed, the attacker gains control before the call finishes, opening opportunities to call back into the original function.

The other issue was that when interacting with ERC20's, it was sometimes to difficult to interpet if they also included these additional standards on top of the base implementation. Some contracts are not designed to handle the kind of token interactions that ERC777 and ERC1363 introduce, which led to unexpected behaviors or security vulnerabilities (re: Uniswap)
